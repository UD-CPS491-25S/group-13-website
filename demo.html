        <p>
            Our application development follows an agile methodology with three planned sprints,
            with the first sprint being devoted to planning and very early initial development work,
            and the latter 2 being dedicated to full-on implementation

                                During our initial sprint, our client outlined their initial goals and plans for the project.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Integrate the app with the tracker being built by a separate engineering team</li>
                                <li>Allow users to view the location data for specific turtles in real time</li>
                                <li>Integrate existing features from the TurtleUp webpage into the app (Shop, About/Info Page)</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>
                                Additionally, the client had requested an iOS and Android compatible version of the app. The original plan
                                for this was to create 2 seperate teams, each creating their own version of the app. While this was intriguing
                                from a learning perspective, as it would allow each team to devote their full attention to each aspect of the app
                                in a full-stack capacity, it became clear this was unfeasable for multiple reasons.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Working as 2 seperate entities would not only result in increased costs for the client (depending on the different
                                design decisions that were made between teams), but would more than likely result in entirely different user experiences
                                across platforms. To remedy this, we combined into a larger overall group, while still delegating individual tasks
                                among our smaller groups. This allows us to work independently while also making sure that everyone understands the 
                                use cases and requirements correctly. We believe that this process will allow to create a more desirable product
                                for our client and the product's eventual users.

                    <h3>Technical Planning</h3>
                    <p>
                        As we decided to build a cross platform app, we decided on using React-Native to best fit our
                        needs. Other options included Swift (iOS), Flutter, or Kotlin, but those options were either not
                        suitable for our needs, or not well supported.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using React-Native presented some challenges at first, but we were able to adapt. Some of these include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding the basic structure of react based apps</li>
                        <li>Knowing the strengths and limitations of certain features across platforms</li>
                        <li>Understanding how to integrate with our planned backend implementation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        On the backend side of development, we opted to use Firebase from Google Cloud as our Database.
                        The main advantage of this was that Firebase was well-suited for real-time updates, which our app
                        was going to require as one of its main features. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with this, we planned to write our backend in Golang, focusing on future stability and
                        speed, ensuring the app remains quick and easy to develop once we are no longer working on it.
                    </p>

                                By the end of sprint 1, we had successfully built a mock-prototype for the app in Figma. 
                                We presented this to our client and she was happy with the design, albiet with a few suggestions.
                                Our next steps were to begin implementing this Figma design inside of react-native.

                        Our second sprint was focused on implementing our initial figma design into an actual app.
                        To do this, we created a shared GitHub repo between the 8 of us that contained our frontend,
                        along with another for our backend. Initial setup involved setting up firebase configs and correctly
                        structuring our react-native project. Once this was complete, we were able to start delegating tasks.

                    <h3>Our Contributions</h3>
                    <p>
                        During Sprint 2, we were able to implement all of the features listed above as a larger group.
                        As a smaller group, however, we were tasked with building the home page, sign in page, and parts
                        of the info/about page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Home Page</h4>
                    <div class="content-with-image">
                        <div class="text-content">
                            <p>
                                The main goal with the home page was to display all of the turtles we stored in our DB in
                                an intuitive manner. The way we decided to design this was to format each turtle document from
                                Firebase into its own "card" that contained all/most of the information contained in the schema.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                We also wanted to make the page somewhat interactive, so we decided on adding a "My Turtles" and
                                "Explore Turtles" tab at the top of the page. The Explore tab would display all turtles to any user, 
                                and the My Turtles tab would display only turtles that are connected to the user. While it has not yet
                                been decided how turtles will be connected to users from a business perspective, our next steps for this
                                page will be actually filtering turtles based on the currently logged in user.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Lastly, icons were added that represent a photo and a map. The photo icon loads an image (specific
                                to the turtle you are currently selecting) from a Firebase storage bucket, and displays it to the user.
                                The next step for this function will be to cache the photos on device to prevent too many reads to the bucket
                                itself. The map icon currently redirects the user to the map page. The next steps for this feature will be
                                to display the selected turtle's location data on screen after being redirected.

                                The main challenge with the home page was understanding home Firebase handles User Auth.
                                Becuase the service already has its own built in way to handle authentication, we decided to use 
                                this feature for out own app. Once we understood how to use the packages Firebase provides for
                                working with react-native, most of the work came down to styling and making the page look visually
                                appealing
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was some communication that had to occur between both sides of the larger group. Most of this
                                happened due to resolving issues connecting the signup and login process, as well as understanding
                                how to use oAuth for allow for signing in with Google, which ultimately presented some issues with cost
                                and cross-compatability.

                                found on the website, but formats it in a way that is more accessible for mobile apps
                                while making the info easier to access, especially as the user is already on the app.
