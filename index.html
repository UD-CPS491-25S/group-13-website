        <h1>Product Description</h1>
        <p>
            TurtleUp is a non-profit dedicated to protecting marine life, specifically sea turtles that live on Ghana's coast. 
            Our team has been tasked with creating an IOS application that interfaces with physical tracking devices that will be placed on sea turtles in Ghana. 
            The hope is that people will be able to watch these turtles as they move through the sea, as well as be able to learn more about TurtleUp. 
            The app will include information on the company and their resources such as their newsletter.

                        React-Native is a resource that allows for cross-platform application development including IOS, Android, and personal computers. 
                        We plan on using the many libraries provided including map API that we can use to track a turtle's path.

                        GoLang is an open-source programming language with a large community behind it. 
                        Because React-Native is a frontend framework, using something like Go will help us with our interactions with the database.
                        We also believe that it will limit future bugs that may arise in the future,
                        as we will only be developing on this app for one semester. We believe Go will help us keep the app 
                        running smoothly for the duration of the project and beyond.

                        Firebase is the perfect database for real-time data updating. 
                        This will be integral so users have fast real-time updates 
                        on the locations of the turtles. Firebase storage buckets allow 
                        dynamic updates to other documents like pictures as the app grows.

                        Expo is a framework used in React Native to simplify the mobile development process. 
                        It provides a set of tools and services that enable developers to build, test, and 
                        deploy mobile applications more efficiently. In our project, Expo Go allows us to ensure
                        consistent design across Android and IOS

        <!-- <h1>Production Updates</h1>
        <p>
            Our team has spent the last month researching the tools necesary to begin development. 
            We have met with our client multiple times to figure out our goals. 
            Our plan in the upcomming month is to begin development. 
            This includes setting up basic user login/signup, information pages (pages for both information on the turtles being tracked as well as the organization itself), 
            a shop page to purchase access to turtle tracking (including the potential for a bracelet), 
            and a map where (once the physical tracker is complete) users can see the path their turtle(s) traveled.
