# Product Description

TurtleUp is a non-profit dedicated to protecting marine life, specifically sea turtles that live on Ghana's coast.  Our team has been tasked with creating an IOS application that interfaces with physical tracking devices that will be placed on sea turtles in Ghana.  The hope is that people will be able to watch these turtles as they move through the sea, as well as be able to learn more about TurtleUp.  The app will include information on the company and their resources such as their newsletter.

# Technical Details

## Frontend: React-Native
React-Native is a resource that allows for cross-platform application development including IOS, Andriod, and personal computers.  We plan on using the many libraries provided including map API that we can use to track a turtles path.

## Backend: GoLang
GoLang is an open-source programming language with a large community behind it.  Because React-Native is a frontend framework, using something like Go will help us with our interactions with the database

## Database: Firebase
Firebase is the perfect database for real-time data updating.  This will be integral so users can have fast real-time updates on the locations of the turtles.

# Production Updates

Our team has spent the last month researching the tools necesary to begin development.  We have met with our client multiple times to figure out our goals.  Our plan in the upcomming month is to begin development.  This includes setting up basic user login/signup, information pages (pages for both information on the turtles being tracked as well as the organization itself), a shop page to purchase access to turtle tracking (including the potential for a bracelet), and a map where (once the physical tracker is complete) users can see the path their turtle(s) traveled.
